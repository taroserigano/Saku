AWS - CloudFront + CloudWatch + CloudTrail + S3 + Route 53 + HTTPS + SSL Certificate

Check out the working website here!: www.szkolasakurami.com/

School Sakurami is a Japanese language school situated in Poland and I've helped them by designing the webstie based on a paprt-kit-template
and then hosted the website on AWS. The domain was initially purchased on Google Domain, so I configured the routing
using Route 53 and then hosted the static website on S3 bucket. I've created additional S3 bucket for logging purposes
in order to track who and when has accessed the website. 

[UPDATE 09.13.2020]
I've also moved the origin point to the CloudFront due to the high demand access from the Europe region.
Now the page loads much much faster and renders the content at lightening speed!

Since the launch of this website, the company started attracting new students and their revenue went up by more than 400%.
What's outstanding is that the costs of hosting this website has been average of about $0.50 per month. 
This is a significantly lower price than hosting the website elsewhere.
